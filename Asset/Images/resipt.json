It is immensely popular all across the country because of its spicy and tangy zest. The generous dose of butter that is often used with freshly-cut onions and lemon juice tops the dish.",

    "steps": "CThere are many ways a frankie recipe can be made. Some folks like to wrap the sabzi/dry veggie curry in roti too and add some extra toppings like mayonnaise, cheese, paneer, sliced raw tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce and sometimes even pickles making a fusion veg frankie or wrap. I have already shared an equally delicious Paneer Kathi Roll and a Veg Roll recipe which you must give a try.",
